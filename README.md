# *SDG*
A basic Calorie Tracker using Pycharms.

# *Project Overview* 
* This sdg-py project was created to fulfill academic requirements, and in accordance with Sustainable Development Goals #3. 

# *Features*
* The Food class is defined using the dataclass decorator from the dataclasses module, representing different food items with attributes such as name, calories, protein, fats, and carbs.
* The main() function is the entry point of the program, providing a menu-driven interface for users to add foods, visualize their nutritional progress, or quit the program.
