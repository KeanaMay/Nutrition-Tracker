Features
The Food class is defined using the dataclass decorator from the dataclasses module, representing different food items with attributes such as name, calories, protein, fats, and carbs.

The main() function is the entry point of the program, providing a menu-driven interface for users to add foods, visualize their nutritional progress, or quit the program.

Adding a New Food: Allows users to input details about a food item (name, calories, protein, fats, carbs) and adds it to the list of tracked foods.

Visualizing Progress: Provides visual representations of macronutrient distribution, progress towards macronutrient goals, and progress towards calorie intake goals using Matplotlib graphs (pie chart, bar chart, and line plot).

Summary Display: Shows a summary of the total intake of calories, protein, fats, and carbs.
